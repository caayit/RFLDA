# RFLDA
This repo contains the Python version of the RFLDA code. The code is 
translated with minimum amount of changes to test the reproducibility.

RFLDA is a model developed by Dengju Yao that uses random forest for
associating lncRNAs with diseases. The data includes already known disease 
associations as well as miRNA-disease associations and lncRNA-miRNA interactions.

I translated the model into a python code with almost no changes in method to
 test the reproducibility, to completely understand the model and to challenge myself.
